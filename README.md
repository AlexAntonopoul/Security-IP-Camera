# Security-IP-camera-triggered-by-motion-and-sound-sensor-on-Raspberry-Pi

In this project we will make a security-IP camera based on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B. 


Hardware components needed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> 1 Raspberry Pi 3 model B
> 1 Raspberry pi camera
> 1 PIR (motion) sensor [HC-SR501]
> 1 Sound sensor-microphone [KY-037]
> 1 Breadboard (maybe)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the system detects movement or sound inside the house the Raspberry Pi camera will start recording!!
The video will be saved into the Rasberry's SDcard, simultaneously the system will stream the recording video
