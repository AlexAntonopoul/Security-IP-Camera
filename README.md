# Security-IP-camera-triggered-by-motion-and-sound-sensor-on-Raspberry-Pi

In this project we will make a security-IP camera based on a Raspberry Pi 3 model B. 


Hardware needed:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> 1 Raspberry Pi 3 model B
> 1 PIR (motion) sensor [HC-SR501]
> 1 Sound sensor-microphone [KY-037]
> 1 Breadboard (maybe)

<<setup photo>>

We will use one sound and one motion sensor. If the system detects movement or sound inside the house the Raspberry Pi camera will start recording!!
